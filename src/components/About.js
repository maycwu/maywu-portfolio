        Welcome to my site! I am a Finance professional turned Software
        Engineer. While working in Finance, I found a passion in programming &
        problem solving which led me to enroll in the Grace Hopper Program at
        Fullstack Academy to become a Software Engineer. I am excited to use my
        creative web development and coding skills to build applications with
        great user experiences.
